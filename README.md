# Automated Speech Recognition System

This system is a work in progress.

It was developed for an NLP course (MPCS53113) at University of Chicago in the Summer of 2019.

It attempts to build a small, lightweight automated speech recognition system using a novel system of my own design.

Unfortunately, I never quite got it working correctly.
